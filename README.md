# CNC-Pendant-Firmware

This is firmware to run on an Arduino to interface a populate style of wired CNC pendant to the PanelDue port of Duet electronics. Build it using Arduino. 

Since the sketch was originally designed for an AtMega8, the pin numbers may need to be adjusted.

Beware that most pendant encoders require +5V or more!
